## 
Android Music Player App with Efficient Track Routing:

## Getting Started ðŸŽ§

- Successfully designed and built an Android application that uses Android SDK to deliver an improved track routing and selection experience for users.
- The application leverages the Bubble sort algorithm to prioritize recently played audio tracks and previews them at the top. This reduces the number of clicks to access tracks to a highly efficient two-step process.

This project utilized the benefits of multiple technologies such as 
- Android SDK
- Kotlin
